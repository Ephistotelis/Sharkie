This game is designed as endless running game. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible! Every score is saved in localstorage and shown on the scoreboard.
Every second you gain 100+ points to your score. 
At the end your score is calculated like this: score over time + (the amount of coins * 500points) + (the amount of kills *300points)
